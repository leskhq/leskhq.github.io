											<p>By licensing the LESK under GPLv3 and the LESK-Modules under the Apache 2 License, we think that a good balance can be reached to ensure that our main contribution remain open-source to both parties (creator and consumer), while allowing creators to still create proprietary and/or commercial modules, and not force them to distribute the source code or have to grant resell rights, therefore protecting their revenue stream if they wish.</p>
