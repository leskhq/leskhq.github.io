											<p>Advanced datatables and reports can be easily created using <a href="http://www.trirand.com/blog/">jqGrid</a> and
											<a href="https://github.com/mgallegos/laravel-jqgrid">mgallegos/laravel-jqgrid</a>.</p>

											<p>The module <a href="https://github.com/leskhq/LESK-Module_ReportsUsers">Report Users</a> provides 2 sample reports:</p>

											<ul>
												<li>A simple user list.</li>
												<li>A list of permissions and roles for each user, grouped by user and roles. This is implemented by first creating a view
												in the database as it would have been too complicated for Laravel Query Builder to handle.</li>
											</ul>

											<p><strong><em>NOTE 1:</em></strong> The view is created in a migration of the module.</p>

											<p><strong><em>NOTE 2:</em></strong> All jqGRids reports are using the base jQuery UI.</p>
